Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, ResNet and VGG Architectures classified the breed in the Dog_01 correctly as 'pug' but AlexNet failed to classify it as 'pug'.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, The Three architectures classify Dog_01 and Dog_02 to be of same breed however ResNet and VGG Architectures classified the breed in the Dog_01 and Dog_02 correctly as 'pug' but AlexNet failed to classify it as 'pug'.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: yes, the three model archotectures classified the Animal_Name_01 which I took as wolf_01 and Object_Name_01 which I took as Baseball_Bat as not dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:From my reseaoning both VGG and ResNet did good at classify the breed correctly, Number of dogs and not dogs correctly however the time elapsed for ResNet was 1 second only whereas for VGG it took 4 seconds, hence for classifying uploaded images I felt ResNet best classified the uploaded images.
